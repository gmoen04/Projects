# Sentiment Analysis

I use almost 250,000 tweets under the #StandWithUkraine hashtag and analysed the sentiment associated with those over the course of the first two weeks of the war. A mapping of real-world events onto the sentiment timeline was also done to attempt to provide explanatory reasoning for the shifts in sentiment.
